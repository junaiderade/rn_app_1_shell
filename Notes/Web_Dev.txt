ðŸŸ¢ INFO
ðŸŸ¡ In a web browser, you can link to different pages using an anchor (<a>) tag. When the user clicks on a link, the URL is pushed to the browser history stack. 
When the user presses the back button, the browser pops the item from the top of the history stack, so the active page is now the previously visited page.
