+++HOW TO
++ Use Twitter API
1. go to twitter docs and open up their postman workspace (this will be different from your own workspace)
2. go to the twitter developer profile and look at your project and get bearer token
3. in your own workpsace try replicating one of teh requests from the twitter workspace (you wil need to add a bearer token authorization)
4. once that work, on the right hand side of the page, there will be a code snippet button, open that and select "Javscript Fetch"
5. copy that code into project and use the fetch method to change some existing code
