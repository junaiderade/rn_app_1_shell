游댮 REACT NATIVE
- Last updated: 7/22

游릭 HOW TO
游리 Build to Xcode
- you need to make sure you have Cocoapods installed
- then you run expo run:ios
- then you open Xcode
- go to the ios folder and open the file with extension .xcworkspace within xcode
游리 Center an element
  center: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    hieght: '100%',
  }
游리 Debug
- shake the phone to access the developer Menu
- errors and warnings are displayed inside LogBox in your app
- notifications can be hidden using <> Logbox.ignoreAllLogs() <> this can be helpful when giving product demos
游리 Open Developer Menu in build App on ios
- shake phone
游리 How to navigate from one screen to next
- install react navigation and use that
游리 Use a global style sheet
- write a normal js file and import it where you need and use the js object you import in the style prop
游리 How to run an alert
() => Alert.alert(username)


游릭 TERMINOLOGY AND INFO
游리 CocoaPods
Manages library dependencies for your Xcode Projects
游리 createStackNavigator function
- returns an object with 2 properties: Screen and navigator
- the Navigator should contain Screen elements as its children to define config for routes
游리 Fast Refresh
- it is a RN feature that allows you to get near instant feedback for changes in your React components
- it is enabled by default
++ Fetch API
- provides an interface for fetching resources across a network.
游리 NavigationContainer component
- manages navigation tree and contains navigation state
- must wrap allnavigators structure
- usually you would render this component at the root of your app
游리 Props
- short for properties, you write them inside your components 
    - ex:       <Cat name="Maru" />
    - the component is written like:
        const Cat = (props) => {
            return (
                <View>
                <Text>Hello, I am {props.name}!</Text>
                </View>
            );
        }
- while props can be considered like arguments you pass, state, is like a components personal data storage
- as a general rule, use props to configure a component when it renders. use state to keep track of anyy component data that you expect to change over time
- this is kinda tricky since u can use props like state but you should not
游리 Style
- all core components accept a prop named style which usually matches how CSS works on the web, except that names are written in camel case
(backgroundColor instead of background-color)
- the style prop can be a plain old js object, you can write it seperately and just be like:
<View style = {styles.container}< and write a js object called styles where you have a nested object called container. look at docs for a better ex.
游리 React Navigation
- presents a straightforward way to navigate between pages using common stack Navigation
- React Navigation's native stack navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens and manage navigation history.
- If your app uses only one stack navigator then it is conceptually similar to how a web browser handles navigation state - your app pushes and pops items from the navigation 
stack as users interact with it, and this results in the user seeing different screens. A key difference between how this works in a web browser and in React Navigation is 
that React Navigation's native stack navigator provides the gestures and animations that you would expect on Android and iOS when navigating between routes in the stack.


游릭 INFO
游리 button does not have a style prop
游리 when you are running something in expo ap on your phone, you need to make sure your laptop and phone are conencted to the same network
游리 when you are writing on press make sure it is a function like 
- () => something
游리 when you try to write a for loop that won't work but a map function will...same thing I think for writing a const vs a function

游리 what is common stack naviagation
游리 what is yarn
++ what is a promise in js?
++ why use the map function instead of being normal

游릭 BLOCKERS
游리 you got an error upon implementing rn navigation and you resolved by first comment in this post: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69043806/requirenativecomponent-rnsscreenstackheaderconfig-was-not-found-in-the-uimana
++ you had an issue running expo on your phone from pc but you had to do expo start --tunnel and you
